<h1>Gear needed before hitting the open trail</h1>
<p>Before heading out into the wilderness it is vital that you have good quality gear and everything you need. In life and death situations (which do happen out there!) your gear can safe your life. With that said, having the correct gear can also just make for a more comfortable trip. I've put together a small list of essentials just to start you off. However, there are some awesome websites out there that have full gear lists for different trails. I know that REI's website has some lists like these.</p>
