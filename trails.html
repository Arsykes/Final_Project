<h1>The Lost Coast Trail</h1>
<p>This trail is located in Northern California and lies in between Humboldt and Mendicino County in Kings Range National Conservation Area. The trail spans 25 miles done the untamed coast. It takes about 3-4 days to hike. Since it passes through areas that are unpassable during high you must plan out ahead of time when the low and high tides are. Camping is allowed anywhere 200ft off the trail but there are plenty of campsites all along the way. It is best to hike this trail North to South so that the wind is blowing at your back and not towards you. Since there are bears in this region of California (don't worry, just black bears) bear canisters are requiared. Your group must register at the trail head and pick up fire permits in order to carry a stove in the back country. This trail will lead you over rolling hills and onto the seemingly never ending shore. It was definitely my favorite trail I have done, However, it takes a bit more planning than most trails and since it is far away from civilization backpackers should know basic first aid and should be novice backpackers.</p>

<h1>Sykes Hot Spring Trail</h1>
<p>The Sykes Trail, located on the central coast of California is a good beginners trail. This trail is ten miles in and ten miles out. It is a more populated trail so I felt safer on this trail then most. It leads into the Ventana Wilderness, a beautiful forest with lots of shade along the trail. This trail does have a few difficult switch backs and a good amount of elevation gain, so it's suggested that backpackers, especially if beginners, are in good shape. This trail leads to some awesome natural hot springs which is a nice reward after a 10 mile trek! I've done this trail in 2 days so it's a nice one for a weekend get away but is also nice for a longer trip if you like to take it slow! There are two campsites before you reach the hots springs for those looking for a longer trip and more exploring.</p>

<h1>The California Riding & Hiking Trail</h1>
<p>This 36 mile trip takes hikers through Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's Desert. This trail is not for the faint of heart. It's a long trek that's one way and requires shuttles and water caches. Although it passes through a popular national park, the trail itself is very desolate. During our 3 day trip we only saw about 4 other groups. The natural water (if you happen to dee any) is preserved for the natural wildlife and flora. Which means before you start your trek you will have to place water caches along the trail. There are backcountry boards that are reachable by car, so planting your trips water isn't too hard to do it does add an extra day to the trip! The desert is hot and you will not be able to recieve much help out here so it's important to do your research before hand and plan plan plan! Not a trail for beginners, however if you're with a group of poeple who know the ropes of backpacking and are in good physical shape you should be fine! There are rattlesnakes and other nasty creautures on this trail so be observant of where you step. With that said, this trail is absolutely breathtaking. I shows off the still of the desert and has many beuatiful plants that look so lively among the heat and sand. The rock formations are also something that draws toruist to this area, and of course the Joshua Trees! (Which aren't actually trees and belong to the Yucca family) But these things are amazing, they thrive in this deathly environment and can live to be hundreds of years old. If you backpack to truly 'get away' then this trail is perfect. </p>
